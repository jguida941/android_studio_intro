# Android Studio Intro - Justin Guida

A simple school assignment for an intro Android development course. The goal of
this module was to get familiar with **Android Studio** and the **Layout Editor**
by building a basic screen - no app logic, just the layout.

## What it is

A single layout (`activity_main.xml`) built with the Layout Editor. It contains
three UI elements:

| Element        | ID               | Notes                        |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Button         | `buttonSayHello` | Text = "Say Hello"           |
| Plain Text (EditText) | `nameText`| Hint = "Enter your name"     |
| TextView       | `textGreeting`   | Intentionally has no text    |

## Screenshots

**Component Tree (three objects + IDs):**

## Component Tree hierarchy

How the three objects nest inside the root container:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["rootLayout<br/>(LinearLayout · vertical)"]
    A --> B["buttonSayHello<br/>Button · text = 'Say Hello'"]
    A --> C["nameText<br/>Plain Text / EditText"]
    A --> D["textGreeting<br/>TextView · no text"]
```

## How the button was centered

Centering is set on the **container** (`rootLayout`), not on the button itself:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Select rootLayout<br/>in Component Tree"] --> G["Open the 'gravity' attribute"]
    G --> U["Uncheck 'bottom'"]
    U --> C["Check center_horizontal<br/>+ center_vertical"]
    C --> R["All 3 children<br/>sit in the middle"]
```

Key idea:
- **`gravity`** on `rootLayout` → positions the children **inside** the container (used here).
- **`layout_gravity`** → would position an element inside **its** parent.
- The button was also shrunk from full width by setting its
  **`layout_width` = `wrap_content`** (instead of `match_parent`).

## Project setup

- **Language:** Java
- **Target SDK:** API 34
- **Build config:** Groovy DSL
- **Activity:** No Activity (per assignment instructions)

## Layout file

The layout lives at:

```
app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
```

## Notes

Personal study notes on the Layout Editor (gravity, text/strings, colors,
centering) are in the [`notes/`](notes/) folder.
